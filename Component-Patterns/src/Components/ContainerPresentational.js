// Keeping the application logic isolated in one place is really crucial, as this provides us with
// a single source of truth that can be referred to for any changes.

// Using the container/presentational paradigm in React is one strategy to ensure the separation of concerns

// We may distinguish between the application logic and the view by employing this pattern

// This pattern is an alternative to the higher-order component pattern in React.

// Containers are components that isolate the application logic,
// restricting their concerns about what data has to be shown
// while presentation components focus on how the data has to be shown.

// Beer.js, a container component
// This is a container component that will contain the application logic
// to fetch the beer list through an API and store the data in the local state.

// Hooks are an excellent addition to the React framework that really helps to isolate the application logic.

// Conclusion

// The contianer/presentational pattern in React is most suited for the
// class-based component where we cannot use the hooks.
// The hook/view pattern is for the functional components in React.

// By separating the concerns, it makes the component more readable and developer-friendly.
